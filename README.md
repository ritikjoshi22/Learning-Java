# Learning-Java

Welcome to the **Learning-Java** repository! This repository is designed for students and enthusiasts who want to start their journey with Java programming. It focuses on foundational concepts and basic practices essential for building real-world applications.

## About This Repository

This repository contains:
- Beginner-friendly Java practice exercises.
- Fundamental concepts to help you master Java basics.
- Preparation for transitioning to advanced projects (to be covered in a new repository).

## Prerequisites

### 1. Install Java
Ensure that Java is installed on your system. Follow these steps:

#### Windows:
1. Download the Java Development Kit (JDK) from the official [Oracle website](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-downloads.html).
2. Run the installer and follow the setup instructions.
3. Set the `JAVA_HOME` environment variable:
   - Open System Properties > Advanced > Environment Variables.
   - Add `JAVA_HOME` with the JDK installation path.
4. Verify installation by running:
   ```bash
   java -version
   ```
   This should display the installed Java version.

#### macOS:
1. Install Java using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/):
   ```bash
   brew install openjdk
   ```
2. Add Java to your environment variables:
   ```bash
   export JAVA_HOME=$(/usr/libexec/java_home)
   ```
3. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   java -version
   ```

#### Linux:
1. Update your package index:
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   ```
2. Install Java:
   ```bash
   sudo apt install openjdk-17-jdk
   ```
3. Verify installation:
   ```bash
   java -version
   ```

### 2. Install an IDE (Eclipse Recommended)
An Integrated Development Environment (IDE) makes Java development easier. We recommend Eclipse:
1. Download Eclipse IDE from the [official website](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/).
2. Install the IDE and select the Java development package.
3. Launch Eclipse, and you're ready to code!

## Running Java Code

1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/Learning-Java.git
   cd Learning-Java
   ```

2. Open Eclipse:
   - Go to **File > Import > Existing Projects into Workspace**.
   - Select the cloned folder and click **Finish**.

3. Run your code:
   - Right-click a Java file in the Project Explorer.
   - Select **Run As > Java Application**.
